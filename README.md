The solution ingests customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL Server into Azure Data Lake using Azure Data Factory, transforms and enriches the data using Azure Databricks following a Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture, and serves analytics-ready data through Azure Synapse Analytics. A Power BI dashboard is used to visualize key business insights such as gender distribution, product category sales, and revenue trends, with interactive filtering by date, gender, and product category.

The pipeline is fully automated, secure, and designed to be reproducible, demonstrating real-world data engineering practices including orchestration, transformation, analytics, and reporting.
